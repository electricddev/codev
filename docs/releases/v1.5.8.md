# v1.5.8

Released: 2025-12-28

## Summary

Bug fix release for remote access mode (`af start --remote`). Fixes several issues that prevented builders, file viewing, and worktree spawning from working correctly when accessing Agent Farm remotely via SSH tunnel.

## Bug Fixes

- **Session rename timing**: Fixed tmux send-keys to use `C-m` instead of `Enter` for reliable session renaming
- **"Already running" case**: Now shows correct dashboard port and keeps SSH connection alive for remote tunnels
- **Builder tab projectId**: Fixed missing `projectId` in builder tabs that caused "Terminal not found: builder-undefined" errors in remote mode
- **Annotation proxy**: Added `/annotation/:id` proxy route for remote file viewing through the dashboard
- **SSH error messages**: Improved error messages to show actual SSH error details instead of generic failure
