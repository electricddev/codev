# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do Codev Protocols and Roles compare to Claude Code subagents and skills?

These are **fundamentally different concepts** that operate at different layers. Here's an accurate comparison:

### Builders vs Subagents

**They are not the same thing.**

| Aspect | Claude Code Subagent | Codev Builder |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| **What it is** | A spawned task within the same Claude session | A **full Claude Code instance** in its own terminal |
| **Isolation** | Shares context with parent | **Isolated git worktree** with its own branch |
| **Lifetime** | Returns result and terminates | Runs until PR is merged |
| **Parallelism** | Limited by token context | True parallelism - multiple terminals |
| **Git access** | Same working directory | Own branch, can commit freely |
| **Human interaction** | None (autonomous task) | Can ask questions, report blocked status |

A Builder is essentially **another human-equivalent developer** working in parallel, not a helper task.

### Roles vs Subagents

**Also not the same thing.**

| Aspect | Claude Code Subagent | Codev Role |
|--------|---------------------|------------|
| **Scope** | Single task | Entire session |
| **How applied** | Task tool spawns it | System prompt loaded at startup |
| **Persistence** | Ephemeral | Persistent throughout session |
| **Purpose** | Parallelize specific work | Define persona, responsibilities, constraints |

A Role (Architect, Builder, Consultant) shapes **how the agent thinks and operates** for an entire session. It's not spawned for a task - it's who the agent *is*.

### Protocols vs Skills

**Different purposes entirely.**

| Aspect | Claude Code Skill | Codev Protocol |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **What it is** | Slash command that injects context | Multi-phase development methodology |
| **Phases** | Single action | Multiple stages with defined transitions |
| **Human gates** | None | Required approvals between phases |
| **Artifacts** | May produce output | Produces specs, plans, reviews |
| **External review** | No | Multi-model consultation built in |

A Protocol like SPIDER defines a complete development lifecycle:
```
Specify (human approval) → Plan (human approval) → Implement → Defend → Evaluate → Review
```

Skills are more like shortcuts or macros. Protocols are methodologies.

### Summary

| Codev Concept | What it actually is | NOT equivalent to |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Builder** | Full Claude instance in isolated worktree | Subagent |
| **Role** | Session-wide persona via system prompt | Subagent |
| **Protocol** | Multi-phase methodology with human gates | Skill |

### How they work together

Codev runs *on top of* Claude Code. The Architect and Builder roles use Claude Code's tools (Bash, Read, Write, Task, etc.) but add:

- **Isolated parallel execution** via git worktrees
- **Structured workflows** with human approval gates
- **External consultation** with other AI models
- **Persistent project tracking** across sessions

Think of Claude Code as the engine. Codev is the operating system that orchestrates it for larger software projects.
